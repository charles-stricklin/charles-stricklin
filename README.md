- 👋 Hi, I’m @charles-stricklin or Charles Stricklin in Human.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code in Swift for iOS principle and possibly macOS later.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Swift.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment because I'd probably just mess your project up I'm so new.
- 📫 The best way to reach me would probably be just an email, I'm using mycode@charlesstricklin.com for now.
- 😄 Pronouns: The whole use of pronouns is asinine and I refuse to participate. Besides, why not just call people by their names, not their pronouns or titles?
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a former Navy enlisted person who is decorated for my service in Operations Desert Shield, Desert Storm, and Southern Watch. I'm a retired IT geek and corporate trainer. I come from Shreveport, Louisiana but now live in San Antonio, Texas and never plan to leave. I've been to 13 countries and 25 of the 50 United States. I have a senior Siamese cat named Mocha. I've coded in Fortran, COBOL, C, JavaScript, PHP, BASIC, and now Swift. I also love a good crawfish etoufee.
